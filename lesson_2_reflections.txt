What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A hidden folder is formed that allows the files to be tracked for version
control. A commit is NOT made by initialization.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area allows you to isolate files that you want to commit
together, to make logical decisions and understand the reasoning for
each commit that was made.


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one
commit per logical change?
Move files to the staging area one at a time or in groups
for each commit.
