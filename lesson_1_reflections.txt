By viewing the diff, I could pinpoint the exact lines that were changed
to find the bugs.

Having access to all versions of a file allows a programmer to easily
revert to when a program was working correctly and track the changes
that were made that led to a program working incorrectly, instead of 
blindly guessing at what went wrong.

The pros of choosing when to commit are that you have flexibility and
the changes are more likely to make sense and have logical progression.
The cons of choosing when to commit are that people can be forgetful or
not have good accumen for making commits at logical time points.

Git is designed for programming, where multiple files call and interact
with each other, so it makes sense that Git allows for multiple files
to be committed together. Google Docs is designed for creating various
types of documents, which don't depend on each other.

Git log lists all the commits of a file. Git diff can show the differences
between different commits.

Using version control, you know you always have the option of reverting
back if something doesn't work.

I want to use git to aid in data science projects.
